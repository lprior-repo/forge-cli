## Test Patterns Established

### 1. Event Verification Pattern

```go
// Verify events generated
assert.NotEmpty(t, stageResult.Events, "Should have events")

// Check specific event
hasEvent := false
for _, event := range stageResult.Events {
    if event.Level == EventLevelInfo && event.Message == "Expected message" {
        hasEvent = true
        break
    }
}
assert.True(t, hasEvent, "Should have expected event")
```

### 2. State Transformation Pattern

```go
stageResult := E.Fold(
    func(e error) StageResult { return StageResult{} },
    func(r StageResult) StageResult { return r },
)(result)

// Verify state changes
assert.Equal(t, expectedValue, stageResult.State.Field)
```

### 3. Error Handling Pattern

```go
result := stage(context.Background(), state)
require.True(t, E.IsLeft(result), "Should return error")

err := E.Fold(
    func(e error) error { return e },
    func(r StageResult) error { return nil },
)(result)

assert.Contains(t, err.Error(), "expected error substring")
```

### 4. Pipeline Integration Pattern

```go
pipeline := NewEventPipeline(
    Stage1V2(),
    Stage2V2(),
    Stage3V2(),
)

result := RunWithEvents(pipeline, ctx, initialState)

// Verify all events collected
assert.NotEmpty(t, stageResult.Events)

// Count events by stage
for _, event := range stageResult.Events {
    // Check for stage-specific events
}
```

## Verified Behaviors

### Event System ✅

1. **Event Creation** - NewEvent and NewEventWithData work correctly
2. **Event Levels** - All levels (Info, Success, Warning, Error) distinct
3. **Event Collection** - RunWithEvents aggregates events from all stages
4. **Event Ordering** - Events maintain order through pipeline
5. **Event Data** - Optional data field works correctly

### State Management ✅

1. **Immutability** - Stages create new State instances
2. **State Flow** - State passes correctly between stages
3. **Config Preservation** - Functions preserved in State.Config
4. **Artifact Tracking** - Artifacts map updated correctly
5. **Output Capture** - Outputs added to state

### Error Handling ✅

1. **Short-Circuit** - Pipeline stops on first error
2. **Error Context** - Errors wrapped with stage context
3. **Either Monad** - Left/Right handling works correctly
4. **Non-Fatal Errors** - Warning events for non-critical failures
5. **Error Messages** - Clear, descriptive error messages

### Pipeline Execution ✅

1. **Sequential Execution** - Stages run in order
2. **Event Aggregation** - All events collected
3. **State Transformation** - Each stage transforms state
4. **Early Termination** - Stops on failure
5. **Final Result** - StageResult contains state + events

## Test Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. Functional Testing

- Pure function behavior verified
- No side effects in tests
- Deterministic results
- No test pollution

### 2. TDD Principles

- Tests written after implementation
- Tests verify behavior, not implementation
- Clear test names describe expected behavior
- Single responsibility per test

### 3. Clean Code

- No test duplication
- Helper functions for common patterns
- Clear assertion messages
- Well-organized test files

### 4. Fast Tests

- No network calls
- No database access
- Minimal file I/O
- Quick execution (<10ms)

---

## Remaining Coverage Gaps

### Pipeline Package (81.8%)

**Missing Coverage:**
- Some error paths in old V1 stages (deprecated)
- Edge cases in parallel execution (TODO)
- Nested error handling in complex chains

**Recommendation:** Acceptable - V2 stages are well-covered

### Other Packages

**Terraform Package (51.4%)**
- Wrapper code has low coverage
- Recommendation: Add integration tests

**Lingon Package (67.4%)**
- Complex type generation not fully tested
- Recommendation: Add property-based tests

**TFModules Package (0%)**
- Generated code, no tests
- Recommendation: Not critical

2. **Event Collection** - Verified through pipeline integration
3. **State Immutability** - Tested by checking new instances
4. **Complex Stages** - Broke down into testable pieces
5. **Integration Tests** - Tested full pipelines without mocks

### Best Practices Established

1. Always verify events generated
2. Test both happy and error paths
3. Use subtests for related cases
4. Mock only at boundaries (Terraform executor)
5. Test state transformations explicitly
